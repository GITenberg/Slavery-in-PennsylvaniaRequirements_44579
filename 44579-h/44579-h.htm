<p class="subtitle"><span class="smcap">The Introduction of Negroes into Pennsylvania.</span></p>

<p>There were negroes in the region around the Delaware river before
Pennsylvania was founded, in the days of the Dutch and the Swedes.
As early as 1639 mention is made of a convict sentenced to be taken
to South River to serve among the blacks there.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> In 1644 Anthony,
a negro, is spoken of in the service of Governor Printz at Tinicum,
making hay for the cattle, and accompanying the governor on his
pleasure yacht.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> In 1657 Vice-director Alricks was accused of using
the Company’s oxen and negroes. Five years later Vice-director Beekman
desired Governor Stuyvesant to send him a company of blacks. In 1664
negroes were wanted to work on the lowlands along the Delaware. A
contract was to be made for fifty, which the West India Company would
furnish.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> In the same year, when the<a id="Page_2" class="pagenum" title="2"></a> English captured New Amstel,
afterward New Castle, the place was plundered, and a number of negroes
were confiscated and sold. From Peter Alricks several were taken; of
these eleven were restored to him.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> At least a few were living on the
shores of the Delaware River in 1677.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> A year later an emissary was
sent by the justices of New Castle to request most urgently permission
to import negroes from Maryland.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Thus negroes had been brought into the country before Pennsylvania
was founded. Immediately after Penn’s coming there is record of them
in his first counties. They were certainly present in Philadelphia
County in 1684, and in Chester in 1687.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Penn himself noticed them
in his charter to the Free Society of Traders. In 1702 they were
spoken of as numerous.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> By that time merchants of Philadelphia made
the im<a id="Page_3" class="pagenum" title="3"></a>portation of negroes a regular part of their business.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
Thenceforth they are a noticeable factor in the life of the colony.</p>

<p>While there was an active demand for negroes, there was, nevertheless,
almost from the first, strong opposition to importing them. This is
evident from the fact that during the colonial period the Assembly of
Pennsylvania passed a long series of acts imposing restrictions upon
the traffic. In 1700 a maximum duty of twenty shillings was imposed
on each negro imported. Five years later this duty was doubled.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
By that time there had arisen a strong adverse sentiment, due partly
to economic causes, since the white workmen complained that their
wages were lowered by negro competition, and partly to fear aroused
by an insurrection of slaves in New York.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Accordingly in 1712 the
Assembly very boldly passed an act to prevent importation, seeking to
accomplish this purpose by making the duty twenty pounds a head. The
law was immediately repealed in England, the Crown not being disposed
to tolerate such independent action, nor willing to allow interference
with the African Company’s trade.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Either the local feeling was too
strong, or the requirements were less, since in spite of this failure
there was for a while a falling off in the<a id="Page_4" class="pagenum" title="4"></a> number imported.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> A
more moderate duty of five pounds was imposed in 1715, but again the
English authorities interposed, repealing it in 1719. Meanwhile an act
to continue this duty had been passed in 1717&ndash;1718, but apparently it
was not submitted to the Crown. In 1720&ndash;1721 the five pound duty was
again imposed, this act also not being submitted. In 1722 the duty was
repeated, and once more the law expired by limitation before it was
sent up for approval.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Up to this time restrictive legislation had been largely frustrated.
It had encountered not only the disapproval of certain classes in
Pennsylvania, but the powerful opposition of the African Company,
which could count on the decisive interposition of the Lords of
Trade.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The Assembly accordingly submitted the acts long after
they had been passed, and made new laws before the old ones had been
disallowed.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Nevertheless the number<a id="Page_5" class="pagenum" title="5"></a> of blacks in the colony had
steadily increased, and in 1721 was estimated to be somewhere between
twenty-five hundred and five thousand.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The wrath of the white
laborers was correspondingly increased, and in this year they presented
to the Assembly a petition asking for a law to prevent the hiring of
blacks. The Assembly resolved that such a law would be injurious to the
public and unjust to those who owned negroes and hired them out, but
the restrictions on importing them were maintained.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> In 1725&ndash;1726
the five pound duty was imposed again, and in the same year five pounds
extra was placed upon every convict negro brought into the colony. This
became law by lapse of time.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>In 1729 the duty was reduced to two pounds. This duty continued in
force for a generation, satisfactory partly because the opposition
to importing negroes seems to have been less strong, partly because
white servants proved to be cheaper and more adapted to industrial
demands.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The newspaper advertisements announce the arrival of many
more cargoes of servants than of negroes; this notwithstanding the fact
that white servants frequently ran away, often to enlist in the wars.
Referring to this fact a message from the Assembly to the governor says
that while the King has seemed to desire the importation of servants
rather than of negroes,<a id="Page_6" class="pagenum" title="6"></a> yet the enlistment acts make such property so
precarious, that it seems to depend on the will of the servant and the
pleasure of the officer.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Nevertheless the number of negroes brought
in steadily dwindled. By 1750 importation had nearly ceased.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>A few years later the great efforts made in the last French and
Indian War caused loud complaints again about enlisting servants. It
was feared that people would be driven to the necessity of providing
themselves with negro slaves, as property in them seemed more secure.
This is probably just what occurred, for the increase of negroes is
said to have been alarming.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> As a result restrictive legislation
was tried again in 1761, when the duty was made ten pounds. The law
was carried only after considerable effort. While the bill was in the
hands of the governor a petition was sent to him, signed by twenty-four
merchants of Philadelphia, who set forth the scarcity and high price of
labor, and their need of slaves. After two months’ contest the bill was
passed. One provision of the act was that a new settler need not pay
the duty if he did not sell his slave within eighteen months.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> In
1768 this act was renewed.<a id="Page_7" class="pagenum" title="7"></a> In 1773 it was made perpetual, the former
law having been found to be of great public utility; but the duty was
raised to twenty pounds. Once more the act became law by lapse of
time.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The act of 1773 was the last one which the Assembly passed to limit
the importation of negroes. Not only was the duty sufficiently high,
now, but its presence was hardly needed.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> A silent but powerful
movement was overthrowing slavery in Pennsylvania; and in a short time
the outbreak of the Revolutionary War brought the traffic to an end.
Shortly thereafter, in 1780, the state did what England had never
permitted while she held authority: forbade the importation of slaves
entirely.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>The real reason for the passage of these laws is not always clear.
They may have been passed either to keep negroes out,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> or to raise
revenue for the govern<a id="Page_8" class="pagenum" title="8"></a>ment.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> An analysis of the laws themselves
seems to show that both of these purposes were constantly in mind.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
When, however, they are taken in connection with matters which they
themselves do not mention, namely, the predominance of the Quakers in
the colonial Assembly together with the abhorrence which they felt for
the slave-trade and later for slavery itself,<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> it be<a id="Page_9" class="pagenum" title="9"></a>comes probable
that the predominant motive was restriction.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> It is also probable
that while the obtaining of revenue was the obvious motive in many of
these acts, yet revenue was so raised precisely because Pennsylvania
desired to keep negroes out; that imported slaves were taxed largely
for reasons similar to those which caused the Stuarts to tax colonial
tobacco, and which lead modern governments to tax spirituous liquors
and opium. It may be added that Pennsylvania always held, both in
colonial times and afterwards, that England forced slavery upon her.
That there was much justice in this complaint the failure of the
earlier legislation goes far to sustain.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>The negroes imported were brought sometimes in cargoes, more often
a few at a time. They came mostly from the West Indies, many being
purchased in Barbadoes, Jamaica, Antigua, and St. Christophers.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> As
a<a id="Page_10" class="pagenum" title="10"></a> rule they were imported by the merchants of Philadelphia, and, being
received in exchange for grain, flour, lumber, and staves, helped to
make up the balance of trade between Philadelphia and the islands.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
A few seem to have been obtained directly from Africa. When so brought,
however, they were found to be unable to endure the winter cold in
Pennsylvania, so that it was considered preferable to buy the second
generation in the West Indies, after they had become acclimated.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
Some were brought from other colonies on the mainland, particularly
those to the south. At times Pennsylvania herself exported a few to
other places.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> The prices paid in the colony naturally fluctuated
from time to time in accordance with supply and demand, and varied
within certain limits according to the age and personal qualities of
each negro. The usual price for an adult seems to have been somewhere
near forty pounds.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p><a id="Page_11" class="pagenum" title="11"></a>
As to the number of negroes in Pennsylvania at different times during
the colonial period almost any estimate is at best conjecture. Not only
are there few official reports, but these reports, in the absence of
any definite census, are of little value.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Apparently one of the
best estimates was that made in 1721, which stated the number of blacks
at anywhere between 2,500 and 5,000.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> In 1751 it was at least widely
believed that<a id="Page_12" class="pagenum" title="12"></a> there were in Philadelphia 6,000, and it is asserted
that the total number in Pennsylvania including the Lower Counties was
11,000.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> It is probable that the same number was not much exceeded
in Pennsylvania proper at any time before 1790. In these estimates no
attempt was made to distinguish the free from the slaves. The number
of slaves, it is true, was very near the total at both these periods,
but after the middle of the century it began dwindling as the number
of negro servants and free men increased. In 1780 a careful estimate
placed the slaves at 6,000.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> According to the Federal census of 1790
the number of negroes in Pennsylvania was 10,274.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>Of these negroes the great majority throughout the slavery period
were located in the southeastern part of Pennsylvania, in and around
Philadelphia. There were many in Bucks, Chester, Lancaster, Montgomery,
and York counties. There were negroes near the site of<a id="Page_13" class="pagenum" title="13"></a> Columbia by
1726. John Harris had slaves by the Susquehanna as early as 1733.
In 1759 Hugh Mercer wrote from the vicinity of Pittsburg asking for
two negro girls and a boy. The tax-lists and local accounts reveal
their presence in many other places.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Doubtless a few might be
traced wherever white people settled permanently. In general it may
be said that they were owned in the English, Welsh, and Scotch-Irish
communities. The Germans as a rule held no slaves.</p>

<p>Where negroes were owned they were for the most part evenly
distributed, there being few large holdings. In rare instances a
considerable number is recorded as belonging to one man, and the
iron-masters generally had several. The tax-lists, however, indicate
that the average holding was one or two, except in Philadelphia among
the wealthier classes where it was double that number.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>The character of slavery in Pennsylvania was in many respects unique,
but in no way was this so true as in connection with the number of
negroes held. Generally speaking, the farther south a section lay the
more<a id="Page_14" class="pagenum" title="14"></a> slaves did it possess. Thus there were fewer in New England than
in the middle colonies; there were fewer there than in the South. But
to this rule Pennsylvania was an exception, for it had fewer negroes
than New Jersey, and not half so many as New York.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> This was due
to two sets of causes: the first, ethical; the second, economic. The
first of these are easily understood. They resulted from the character
of many of the people who settled Pennsylvania, their dislike for
slavery, and their refusal to hold slaves. The second are not so easily
traceable, but were doubtless more powerful in their influence, for
they were owing to the character of Pennsylvania’s industrial growth.</p>

<p>The plantation system, which is most favorable to the increase of
slavery, never appeared in Pennsylvania. During the whole of the
eighteenth century the activities of the colony developed along two
lines not favorable to negro labor: small farming, and manufacturing
and commerce.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> The small farms were almost always held by people
who were too poor to purchase slaves, at least for a long while, and
the kind of farming was not such as to make slavery particularly
profitable. In commerce no large number of negroes was ever employed,
while manufacturing demanded a higher grade of labor than slaves could
give. It is true that in some cases where there was an approach to
the factory system, and where the work was rough and needed little
skill, slaves could answer every purpose. For this reason at the old<a id="Page_15" class="pagenum" title="15"></a>
ironworks negroes were in demand.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> As a rule, however, this was not
the case. It was because of its industrial character that Pennsylvania
was peculiarly the colony of indentured white servants.</p>

<p>Furthermore, ethical and economic influences interacted with subtle
and powerful force. Barring all other considerations, the cost of a
slave was a considerable item, not to be afforded by a struggling
settler; hence slavery never attained magnitude on the frontier. Before
1700 Pennsylvania was all frontier; hence it had very few negroes. In
the period from 1700 to about 1750 the country between the Delaware
and the Susquehanna was filled up, and the early conditions largely
disappeared. It was then that the greatest number of negroes was
introduced. In the period between the middle of the century and the
Revolution this older country became well developed and prosperous;
farms became larger and better cultivated; there were numerous
respectable manufacturers and wealthy merchants. These men could
easily afford to have slaves, and large importations might have been
expected; but there was no great influx of negroes. Economic conditions
were favorable, but ethical influences worked strongly against it. In
this eastern half of Pennsylvania two racial elements predominated:
the Germans and the English Quakers. The Germans had abstained from
slave-holding from the first;<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> the Quakers were now coming to abhor
it.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> The same play of causes was seen again in the “old West.”
After 1750 in the mountains and valleys beyond the Susquehanna the
earlier frontier condi<a id="Page_16" class="pagenum" title="16"></a>tions were lived over again. Here the settlers
were largely Scotch-Irish, and had no dislike for slavery, but as yet
the conditions of their life did not favor it. When finally western
Pennsylvania passed out of the frontier stage, and its inhabitants
could purchase negroes, the days of slavery in Pennsylvania were nearly
over.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> For all of these reasons from first to last Pennsylvania’s
slave population remained small.</p>

<a id="CHAP_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="subtitle"><span class="smcap">Legal Status of the Slave.</span></p>


<p>The legal origin of slavery<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> in Pennsylvania is not easy to
discover, for the statute of 1700, which seems to have recognized
slavery there, is, like similar statutes in some of the other American
colonies, very indirect and uncertain in its wording. Before this time,
it is true, there occur instances where negroes were held for life, so
that undoubtedly there was <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">de facto</em> slavery; but by what authority it
existed, or how it began, is not clear. It may have grown up to meet
the necessities of a new country. It may have been an inheritance from
earlier colonists. More probably still, it developed by diverging from
temporary servitude which, in the case of white servants at least,
flourished among the earliest English settlers in the region.</p>

<p>It is probable that slavery existed among the Dutch of New Netherland,
and possibly among the Swedes along the Delaware.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> In 1664 their
settlements passed under English authority. To regulate them the
so-called “Duke of York’s Laws” were promulgated. Meanwhile around the
estuary of the Delaware English colonists were settling with their
negroes. In 1676, five<a class="pagenum" id="Page_18" title="18"></a> years before Penn set out for his territories,
the Duke’s laws seem to have been obeyed in part of the Delaware River
country.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> In these laws servants for life are explicitly mentioned.
In them it is also ordained that no Christian shall be held in bond
slavery or villenage.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> This latter may be a tacit permission to hold
heathen negroes as slaves.</p>

<p>Not much can be based upon the Duke of York’s laws since their meaning
upon this latter point is doubtful. Moreover, when Penn founded his
colony they were superseded after a short time by laws enacted in
Pennsylvania assemblies. In the years following at first no act was
passed recognizing slavery, but that some slaves were held there
is apparent. Numerous little pieces of evidence may be accumulated
indicating that there were negroes who were not being held as servants
for a term of years, nor does anything appear to indicate that this
was looked upon as illegal.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> In 1685 William Penn,<a class="pagenum" id="Page_19" title="19"></a> writing to his
steward at Pennsbury, said that it would be better to have blacks to
work the place, since they might be held for life.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> In the same
year by the terms of a recorded deed a negro was sold to a new master
“forever.”<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Three years later the Friends of Germantown issued
their celebrated protest against slavery,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> while in 1693 George
Keith denounced the practice of enslaving men and holding them in
perpetual bondage.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Meanwhile no law was made authorizing slavery
in the colony, and no court seems to have been called upon to decide
whether slavery was legal. It is not until 1700 that a statute was
passed bearing upon the subject. In that year a law for the regulation
of servants contains a section designed to prevent the embezzlement by
servants of their masters’ goods. This section asserts that the servant
if white shall atone for such theft by additional<a id="Page_20" class="pagenum" title="20"></a> servitude at the end
of his time sufficient to pay for double the value of the goods; but
if black he shall be severely whipped in the most public place of the
township.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> It is probable that the law was so worded because it had
come to be seen that there were few cases in which a negro could give
satisfaction by additional time at the end of his term, since negroes
were being held for life. If such be the case, this law may be said to
contain the formal recognition of slavery in the colony.</p>

<p>The legal development of this slavery was rapid and brief. As it was
not created by statutory enactment, so some of its most important
incidents were never alluded to in the laws. The Assembly of
Pennsylvania, unlike that of Virginia, never seems to have thought
it necessary to define the status of the slave as property, the
consequences of slave baptism, or the line of servile descent.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
Some of these questions had been settled in other colonies before
the founding of Pennsylvania, and there the results seem to have
been accepted. Accordingly the steps in the development are neither
obvious nor distinct. They rest not so much upon statute as upon court
decisions interpreting usage, and in many cases the decisions do not
come until the end of the slavery period. Notwithstanding all this
there was a development, which may be said to fall into three periods.
They were, first, the years from 1682 to 1700, when slavery was slowly
diverging from servitude, which it still closely resembled; second,
from 1700 to 1725&ndash;1726, when slavery was more sharply marked off from
servi<a id="Page_21" class="pagenum" title="21"></a>tude; and third, the period from 1725&ndash;1726 to 1780, when nothing
was added but some minor restrictions.</p>

<p>During the earliest years slavery in Pennsylvania differed from
servitude in but little, save that servitude was for a term of years
and slavery was for life. It may be questioned whether at first all men
recognized even this difference. Many of Penn’s first colonists were
men who embarked upon their undertaking with high ideals of religion
and right, and whose conception of what was right could not easily be
reconciled with hopeless bondage.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> The strength of this sentiment is
seen in the well known provision of Penn’s charter to the Free Society
of Traders, 1682, that if they held blacks they should make them free
at the end of fourteen years, the blacks then to become the Company’s
tenants.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> It is the motive in Benjamin Furley’s proposal to hold
negroes not longer than eight years.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> It is particularly evident
in the protest made at Germantown in 1688.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> It is seen in George
Keith’s declaration of principles in 1693.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> And it gave impetus to
the movement among the Friends, which, starting about 1696, led finally
to the emancipation of all their negroes.</p>

<p><a id="Page_22" class="pagenum" title="22"></a>
Accordingly at first there may have been some negroes who were held as
servants for a term of years, and who were discharged when they had
served their time.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> There is no certain proof that this was so,<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
and the probabilities are rather against it, but the conscientious
scruples of some of the early settlers make it at least possible.
In the growth of the colony, however, this feeling did not continue
strong enough to be decisive. Economic adjustment, an influx of men of
different standards, and motives of expediency, perhaps of necessity,
made the legal recognition of an inferior status inevitable. Against
this the upholders of the idea that negroes should be held only as
servants, for a term of years, waged a losing fight. It is true they
did not desist, and in the course of one hundred years their view
won a complete triumph; but their success came in abolition, and in
overthrowing a system established, long after they had utterly failed
to prevent the swift growth and the statutory recognition of legal
slavery for life and in perpetuity.</p>

<p>Aside from this one fundamental difference the incidents of each status
were nearly the same. The negro held for life was subject to the same
restrictions, tried in the same courts, and punished with the same
punishments as the white servant. So far as either class was subject
to special regulation at this time it was because of the laws for
the management of servants, passed in 1683 and 1693, which concerned
white servants equally with black slaves. These restrictions were as
yet neither<a id="Page_23" class="pagenum" title="23"></a> numerous nor detailed, being largely directed against
free people who abetted servants in wrong doing. Thus, servants were
forbidden to traffic in their masters’ goods; but the only penalty
fell on the receiver, who had to make double restitution. They were
restricted as to movement, and when travelling they must have a pass.
If they ran away they were punished, the white servant by extra
service, the black slave by whipping, but this different punishment for
the slave was not enacted until 1700, the beginning of the next period.
Whoever harbored them was liable to the master for damages.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> The
relations between master and servant were likewise simple. The servant
was compelled to obey the master. If he resisted or struck the master,
he was punished at the discretion of the court. On the other hand the
servant was to be treated kindly.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>The period, then, prior to 1700 was characteristically a period
of servitude. The laws spoke of servants white and black.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> The
regulations, the restrictions, the trials, the punishments, were
identical. There was only the one difference: white servants were
discharged with freedom dues at the end of a specified number of years;
for negroes there was no discharge; they were servants for life, that
is, slaves.</p>

<p>In the period following 1700 this difference gradually became apparent,
and made necessary different treat<a id="Page_24" class="pagenum" title="24"></a>ment and distinct laws. This
resulted from a recognition of the dissimilarity in character between
property based on temporary service and that based on service for
life. In the first place perpetual service gave rise to a new class of
slaves. At first the only ones in Pennsylvania were such negroes as
were imported and sold for life. But after a time children were born
to them. These children were also slaves, because ownership of a negro
held for life involved ownership of his offspring also, since, the
negro being debarred by economic helplessness from rearing children,
all of his substance belonging to his master, the master must assume
the cost of rearing them, and might have the service of the children
as recompense.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> This was the source of the second and largest class
of slaves. The child of a slave was not necessarily a slave if one
of the parents was free. The line of servile descent lay through the
mother.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Accordingly the child of a slave mother and a free father
was a slave, of a free mother and a slave father a servant for a term
of years only. The result<a id="Page_25" class="pagenum" title="25"></a> of the application of this doctrine to the
offspring of a negro and a white person was that mulattoes were divided
into two classes. Some were servants for a term of years; the others
formed a third class of slaves.</p>

<p>In the second place perpetual service gave to slave property more of
the character of a thing, than was the case when the time of service
was limited. The service of both servants and slaves was a thing,
which might be bought, sold, transferred as a chattel, inherited and
bequeathed by will; but in the case of a slave, the service being
perpetual, the idea of the service as a thing tended to merge into
the idea of the slave himself as a thing. The law did not attempt to
carry this principle very far. It never, as in Virginia, declared the
slave real estate. In Pennsylvania he was emphatically both person and
thing, with the conception of personality somewhat predominating.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
Yet there was felt to be a decided difference between the slave and the
servant, and this, together with the desire to regulate the slave as a
negro distinguished from a white man, was the cause of the distinctive
laws of the second period.</p>

<p><a id="Page_26" class="pagenum" title="26"></a>
The years from 1700 to 1725&ndash;1726 are marked by two great laws which
almost by themselves make up the slave code of Pennsylvania. The first,
passed in 1700 and passed again in 1705&ndash;1706, regulated the trial and
punishments of slaves.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> It marked the beginning of a new era in the
regulation of negroes, in that, subjecting them to different courts and
imposing upon them different penalties, it definitely marked them off
as a class distinct from all others in the colony. In 1725&ndash;1726 further
advance was made. Not only was the negro now subjected to special
regulation because he was a slave, but whether slave or free he was
now made subject to special restrictions because he was a negro. While
some of these had to do with movement and behavior, the most important
forbade all marriage or intercourse with white people.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> These laws
must be examined in detail.</p>

<p>From the very first was seen the inevitable difficulty involved in
punishing the negro criminal as a person, and yet not injuring the
master’s property in the thing. The result of this was that masters
were frequently led to conceal the crimes of their slaves, or to take
the law into their own hands.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> The solution was probably felt to be
the removal of negroes from the ordinary courts. It is said, also, that
Penn desired to protect the negro by clearly defining his crimes and
apportioning his punishments. Accordingly he urged the law of 1700.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>

<a id="Page_27" class="pagenum" title="27"></a></p>

<p>Under this law negroes when accused were not to be tried in the regular
courts of the colony. They were to be presented by the Courts of
Quarter Sessions, but the cases were to be dealt with by special courts
for the trial of negroes, composed of two commissioned justices of the
peace and six substantial freeholders. On application these courts
were to be constituted by executive authority when occasion demanded.
Witnesses were to be allowed, but there was to be no trial by jury.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
In such courts it was doubtless easier to regard the slave as property,
and do full justice to the rights of the master.</p>

<p>Something was still wanting, however, for in case the slave criminal
was condemned to death, the loss fell entirely on the master. From
the earliest days of the colony owners had been praying for relief
from this. In 1707 the masters of two slaves petitioned the governor
to commute the death sentence to chastisement and transportation, and
thus save them from pecuniary loss. The petition was granted. Such
commutation was frequently sought, and in the special courts it could
be more readily granted.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> The real solution, however, was discovered
in 1725&ndash;1726, when it was ordained that there<a class="pagenum" id="Page_28" title="28"></a>after if any slave
committed a capital crime, immediately upon conviction the justices
should appraise such slave, and pay the value to the owner, out of a
fund arising principally from the duty on negroes imported.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>These laws continued in force until 1780, and down to that time slaves
were removed from the jurisdiction of the regular courts of the
province; although after 1776 it was asserted that the clause about
trial by jury in the new state constitution affected slaves as well as
free men; and a slave was actually so tried in 1779.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Whether this
view prevailed in all quarters it is impossible to say. In the next
year the abolition act did away with the special courts entirely.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>

<a id="Page_29" class="pagenum" title="29"></a></p>

<p>The law of 1700, which marked the differentiation of slaves from
servants, marked also the beginning of discrimination. For negroes
there were to be different punishments as well as a different mode
of trial. Murder, buggery, burglary, or rape of a white woman, were
to be punished by death; attempted rape by castration; robbing and
stealing by whipping, the master to make good the theft.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> This law
was repeated in 1705&ndash;1706, except that the punishment for attempted
rape was now made whipping, branding, imprisonment, and transportation,
while these same penalties were to be imposed for theft over five
pounds. Theft of an article worth less than five pounds entailed
whipping up to thirty-nine lashes.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> For white people at this time,
whether servants or free, there was a different code.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>A far more important discrimination was made in 1725&ndash;1726 by the law
which forbade mixture of the races. There had doubtless been some
intercourse from the first. A white servant was indicted for this<a id="Page_30" class="pagenum" title="30"></a>
offence in 1677; and a tract of land in Sussex County bore the name
of “Mulatto Hall.” In 1698 the Chester County Court laid down the
principle that mingling of the races was not to be allowed.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> The
matter went beyond this, for in 1722 a woman was punished for abetting
a clandestine marriage between a white woman and a negro.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> A few
months thereafter the Assembly received a petition from inhabitants of
the province, inveighing against the wicked and scandalous practice of
negroes cohabiting with white people.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> It appeared to the Assembly
that a law was needed, and they set about framing one. Accordingly in
the law of 1725&ndash;1726 they provided stringent penalties. No negro was to
be joined in marriage with any white person upon any pretense whatever.
A white person violating this was to forfeit thirty pounds, or be sold
as a servant for a period not exceeding seven years. A clergyman who
abetted such a marriage was to pay one hundred pounds.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>The law did not succeed in checking cohabitation,<a id="Page_31" class="pagenum" title="31"></a> though of marriages
of slaves with white people there is almost no record.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> There exists
no definite information as to the number of mulattoes in the colony
during this period, but advertisements for runaway slaves indicate that
there were very many of them. The slave register of 1780 for Chester
County shows that they constituted twenty per cent. of the slave
population in that locality.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> It must be said that the stigma of
illicit intercourse in Pennsylvania would not generally seem to rest
upon the masters, but rather upon servants, outcasts, and the lowlier
class of whites.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>Negro slaves were subject to another class of restrictions which were
made against them rather as slaves than as black men. These concerned
freedom of movement and freedom of action. During the earlier years of
the colony’s history regulation of the movements of the slaves rested
principally in the hands of the owners. The continual complaints about
the tumultuous assembling of negroes, to be noticed presently, would
seem to<a id="Page_32" class="pagenum" title="32"></a> indicate that considerable leniency was exercised.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> But
frequently white people lured them away, and harbored and employed
them.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> The law of 1725&ndash;1726 was intended specially to stop this.
No negro was to go farther than ten miles from home without written
leave from his master, under penalty of ten lashes on his bare back.
Nor was he to be away from his master’s house, except by special leave,
after nine o’clock at night, nor to be found in tippling-houses, under
like penalty. For preventing these things counter-restrictions were
imposed upon white people. They were forbidden to employ such negroes,
or knowingly to harbor or shelter them, except in very unseasonable
weather, under penalty of thirty shillings for every twenty-four hours.
Finally it was provided that negroes were not to meet together in
companies of more than four. This last seems to have remained a dead
letter.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>That this legislation failed to produce the desired effect is shown by
the experience of Philadelphia in dealing with negro disorder. Such
disorder was complained of as early as 1693, when, on presentment
of the grand jury, it was directed that the constables or any other
person should arrest such negroes as they might find gadding abroad on
first days of the week, without written permission from the master,
and take them to jail, where, after imprisonment, they should be given
thirty-nine lashes well laid on, to be paid for by the master. This
seems to have been enforced but laxly, for in 1702<a id="Page_33" class="pagenum" title="33"></a> the grand jury
presented the matter again, and their recommendation was repeated with
warmth in the year following.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> A few years later they urged measures
to suppress the unruly negroes of the city.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> In 1732 the council
was forced to recommend an ordinance to bring this about, and such an
ordinance was drawn up and considered. Next year the Monthly Meeting
of Friends petitioned, and the matter was taken up again, but nothing
came of it, so that the council was compelled to observe that further
legislation was assuredly needed.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> In 1741 the grand jury presented
the matter strongly,<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> and an explicit order was at last given that
constables should disperse meetings of negroes within half an hour
after sunset.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> The nuisance, probably, was still not<a id="Page_34" class="pagenum" title="34"></a> abated,
for in 1761 the mayor caused to be published in the papers previous
legislation on the subject.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Nothing further seems to have been
done.</p>

<p>The continued failure to suppress these meetings in defiance of a law
of the province, must be attributed either to the intrinsic difficulty
of enforcing such a law, or to the fact that the meetings were
objectionable because of their rude and boisterous character, rather
than because of any positive misdemeanor. More probably still this is
but one of the many pieces of evidence which show how leniently the
negro was treated in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The third period, from 1726 to 1780, is distinguished more because
of the lack of important legislation about the negro than through
any marked character of its own. The outlines of the colony’s slave
code had now been drawn, and no further constructive work was done.
There is, however, one class of laws which may be assigned to this
period, since the majority of them fall chronologically within its
limits, though they are scarcely more characteristic of it than they
are of either of the two periods preceding. All of these laws imposed
restrictions upon the actions of negro slaves in matters in which white
people were restricted also, but the restrictions were embodied in
special sections of the laws, because of the negro’s inability to pay a
fine: the law imposing corporal punishment upon the slave, whenever it
exacted payment in money or imprisonment from others.</p>

<p>Thus, an act forbidding the use of fireworks without the governor’s
permission, states that the slave instead<a id="Page_35" class="pagenum" title="35"></a> of being imprisoned shall
be publicly whipped. Another provides that if a slave set fire to any
woodlands or marshes he shall be whipped not exceeding twenty-one
lashes. As far back as 1700 whipping had been made the punishment of a
slave who carried weapons without his master’s permission. In 1750&ndash;1751
participation in a horse-race or shooting-match entailed first fifteen
lashes, and then twenty-one, together with six days’ imprisonment for
the first offense, and ten days’ imprisonment thereafter. In 1760
hunting on Indians’ lands or on other people’s lands, shooting in the
city, or hunting on Sunday, were forbidden under penalty of whipping
up to thirty-one lashes. In 1750&ndash;1751 the penalty for offending
against the night watch in Philadelphia was made twenty-one lashes
and imprisonment in the work-house for three days at hard labor; for
the second offence, thirty-one lashes and six days. Sometimes it was
provided that a slave might be punished as a free man, if his master
would stand for him. Thus a slave offending against the regulations
for wagoners was to be whipped, or fined, if his master would pay the
fine.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>So far the slave was under the regulation of the state. He was also
subject to the regulation of his owner, who,<a id="Page_36" class="pagenum" title="36"></a> in matters concerning
himself and not directly covered by laws, could enforce obedience by
corporal punishment. This was sometimes administered at the public
whipping-post, the master sending an order for a certain number of
lashes.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> But the slave was not given over absolutely into the
master’s power. If he had to obey the laws of the state, he could
also expect the protection of the state.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> The master could not
starve him, nor overwork him, nor torture him. Against these things
he could appeal to the public authorities. Moreover public opinion
was powerfully against them. If a master killed his slave the law
dealt with him as though his victim were a white man.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> It is not
probable, to be sure, that the sentence was often carried out, but such
cases did not often arise.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>Such was the legal status of the slave in Pennsylvania. Before 1700 it
was ill defined, but probably much like that of the servant, having
only the distinctive incident of perpetual service, and the developing
incident of the transmission of servile condition to offspring.
Gradu<a id="Page_37" class="pagenum" title="37"></a>ally it became altogether different. To the slave now appertained
a number of incidents of lower status. He was tried in separate courts,
subject to special judges, and punished with different penalties.
Admixture with white people was sternly prohibited. He was subject to
restrictions upon movement, conduct, and action. He could be corrected
with corporal punishment. The slave legislation of Pennsylvania
involved discriminations based both upon inferior status, and what
was regarded as inferior race. Nevertheless it will be shown that in
most respects the punishments and restrictions imposed upon negro
slaves were either similar to those imposed upon white servants, or
involved discriminations based upon the inability of the slave to pay
a fine, and upon the fact that mere imprisonment punished the master
alone. Moreover, what harshness there was must be ascribed partly to
the spirit of the times, which made harsher laws for both white men
and black men. The slave code almost never comprehended any cruel or
unusual punishments. As a legal as well as a social system slavery in
Pennsylvania was mild.</p>

<p>The mildness of slavery in Pennsylvania impressed every observer.
Acrelius said that negroes were treated better there than anywhere else
in America. Peter Kalm said that compared with the condition of white
servants their condition possessed equal advantages except that they
were obliged to serve their whole life-time without wages. Hector St.
John Crèvecœur declared that they enjoyed as much liberty as their
masters, that they were in effect part of their masters’ families, and
that, living thus, they considered themselves happier than many of the
lower class of whites.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> There is good reason for believing these
statements, since a careful study of the sources shows that generally
masters used their negroes kindly and with moderation.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>Living in a land of plenty the slaves were well fed and comfortably
clothed. They had as good food as the white servants, says one
traveller, and another says as good as their masters.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> In 1759 the
yearly cost of the food of a slave was reckoned at about twenty per
cent. of his value.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> Likewise they were well clad, their<a id="Page_39" class="pagenum" title="39"></a> clothes
being furnished by the masters. That clothes were a considerable item
of expense is shown by the old household accounts and diaries. Acrelius
computed the yearly cost at five per cent. of a slave’s value.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
In the newspaper advertisements for runaways occur particularly full
descriptions of their dress.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Almost always they have a coat or
jacket, shoes, and stockings.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> It is true that when they ran
away they generally took the best they had, if not all they had; but
making due allowance it seems certain that they were well clad, as an
advertiser declared.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>As to shelter, since the climate and economy of Pennsylvania never
gave rise to a plantation life, rows of<a id="Page_40" class="pagenum" title="40"></a> negro cabins and quarters for
the hands never became a distinctive feature. Slaves occupied such
lodgings as were assigned to white servants, generally in the house of
the master. This was doubtless not the case where a large number was
held. They can hardly have been so accommodated by Jonathan Dickinson
of Philadelphia, who had thirty-two.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>In the matter of service their lot was a fortunate one. There seems to
be no doubt that they were treated much more kindly than the negroes in
the West Indies, and that they were far happier than the slaves in the
lower South. It is said that they were not obliged to labor more than
white people, and, although this may hardly have been so, and although,
indeed, there is occasional evidence that they were worked hard, yet
for the most part it is clear that they were not overworked.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> The
advertisements of negroes for sale show, as might be expected, that
most of the slaves were either house-servants or farm-hands.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
Nevertheless the others were<a id="Page_41" class="pagenum" title="41"></a> engaged in a surprisingly large number
of different occupations. Among them were bakers, blacksmiths,
brick-layers, brush-makers, carpenters, coopers, curriers, distillers,
hammermen, refiners, sail-makers, sailors, shoe-makers, tailors, and
tanners.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> The negroes employed at the iron-furnaces received
special mention.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> The women cooked, sewed, did house-work, and at
times were employed as nurses.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> When the service of negroes was
needed they were often hired from their masters, but as a rule they
were bought.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> They were frequently trusted and treated almost like
members of the family.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>

<a id="Page_42" class="pagenum" title="42"></a></p>

<p>When the day’s work was over the negroes of Pennsylvania seem to have
had time of their own which they were not too tired to enjoy. Some no
doubt found recreation in their masters’ homes, gossipping, singing,
and playing on rude instruments.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Many sought each other’s company
and congregated together after nightfall. In Philadelphia, at any rate,
during the whole colonial period, crowds of negroes infesting the
streets after dark behaved with such rough and boisterous merriment
that they were a nuisance to the whole community.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> At times negroes
were given days of their own. They were allowed to go from one place to
another, and were often permitted to visit members of their families
in other households.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> Moreover, holidays were not grudged them.
It is said that in Philadelphia at the time of fairs, the blacks to
the number of a thousand of both sexes used to go to “Potter’s Field,”
and there amuse themselves, dancing, singing, and rejoicing, in native
barbaric fashion.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>If, now, from material comfort we turn to the matter of the moral and
intellectual well-being of the slaves, we find that considering the
time, surprising efforts were made to help them. In Pennsylvania there
seems<a id="Page_43" class="pagenum" title="43"></a> never to have been opposition to improving them. Not much was
done, it is true, and perhaps most of the negroes were not reached
by the efforts made. It must be remembered, however, what violent
hostility mere efforts aroused in some other places.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>There is the statement of a careful observer that masters desired
by all means to hinder their negroes from being instructed in the
doctrines of Christianity, and to let them live on in pagan darkness.
This he ascribes to a fear that negroes would grow too proud on seeing
themselves upon a religious level with their masters.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> Some weight
must be attached to this account, but it is probable that the writer
was roughly applying to Pennsylvania what he had learned in other
places, for against his assertion much specific evidence can be arrayed.</p>

<p>The attention of the Friends was directed to this subject very early.
The counsel of George Fox was explicit. Owners were to give their
slaves religious instruction and teach them the Gospel.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> In 1693
the Keithian Quakers when advising that masters should hold their
negroes only for a term of years, enjoined that during such time they
should give these negroes a Christian education.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> In 1700 Penn
appears to have<a id="Page_44" class="pagenum" title="44"></a> been able to get a Monthly Meeting established for
them, but of the meeting no record has come down.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> As to what was
the actual practice of Friends in this matter their early records give
meagre information. It seems certain that negroes were not allowed to
participate in their meetings, though sometimes they were taken to the
meeting-houses.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> It is probable that in great part the religious
work of the Friends among slaves was confined to godly advice and
reading.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> As to the amount and quality of such advice, the well
known character of the Friends leaves no doubt.</p>

<p>The Moravians, who were most zealous in converting negroes, did not
reach a great number in Pennsylvania, because few were held by them;
nevertheless they labored successfully, and received negroes amongst
them on terms of religious equality.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> This also the Lutherans did
to some extent, negroes being baptized among them.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> It is in the
case of the Episcopalians, however, that the most definite knowledge
remains. The records of Christ Church show that the negroes who
were baptized made no inconsiderable proportion of the total number
baptized in the congregation. For a period of more than seventy years
such baptisms are recorded, and are sometimes numerous.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> At this
church,<a id="Page_45" class="pagenum" title="45"></a> also, there was a minister who had special charge of the
religious instruction of negroes.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> It is possible that something
may have been accomplished by missionaries and itinerant exhorters.
This was certainly so when Whitefield visited Pennsylvania in 1740.
Both he and his friend Seward noted with peculiar satisfaction the
results which they had attained.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> Work of some value was also done
by wandering negro exhorters, who, appearing at irregular intervals,
assembled little groups and preached in fields and orchards.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>Something was also accomplished for negroes in the maintenance of
family life. In 1700 Penn, anxious to improve their moral condition,
sent to the Assembly a bill for the regulation of their marriages,
but much to his grief this was defeated.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> In the absence of such<a id="Page_46" class="pagenum" title="46"></a>
legislation they came under the law which forbade servants to marry
during their servitude without the master’s consent.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> Doubtless
in this matter there was much of the laxity which is inseparable from
slavery, but it is said that many owners allowed their slaves to marry
in accordance with inclination, except that a master would try to have
his slaves marry among themselves.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> The marriage ceremony was
often performed just as in the case of white people, the records of
Christ Church containing many instances.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> The children of these
unions were taught submission to their parents, who were indulged, it
is said, in educating, cherishing,<a id="Page_47" class="pagenum" title="47"></a> and chastising them.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> Stable
family life among the slaves was made possible by the conditions of
slavery in Pennsylvania, there being no active interchange of negroes.
When they were bought or sold families were kept together as much as
possible.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>In one matter connected with religious observances race prejudice was
shown: negroes were not as a rule buried in the cemeteries of white
people.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> In some of the Friends’ records and elsewhere there is
definite prohibition.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> They were often buried in their masters’
orchards, or on the edge of woodlands. The Philadelphia negroes were
buried in a particular place outside the city.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>Under the kindly treatment accorded them the negroes of colonial
Pennsylvania for the most part behaved fairly well. It is true that
there is evidence that crime among them assumed grave proportions
at times, while the records of the special courts and items in the
newspapers show that there occurred murder, poisoning, arson, burglary,
and rape.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> In addition there was fre<a class="pagenum" id="Page_48" title="48"></a>quent complaint about
tumultuous assembling and boisterous conduct, and there was undoubtedly
much pilfering.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> Moreover the patience of many indulgent masters
was tried by the shiftless behavior and insolent bearing of their
slaves.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> Yet the graver crimes stand out in isolation rather than
in mass; and it is too much to expect an entire absence of the lesser
ones. The white people do not seem to have regarded their negroes as
dangerous.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> Almost never were there efforts for severe repression,
and a slave insurrection seems hardly to have been thought of.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>
There are no statistics whatever on which to base an estimate, but
judging from the relative frequency of notices it seems probable that
crime among the negroes of Pennsylvania during the slavery period--no
doubt because they were under better control&mdash;was less than at any
period thereafter.</p>

<p>But there was a misdemeanor of another kind: negro<a id="Page_49" class="pagenum" title="49"></a> slaves frequently
ran away. Fugitives are mentioned from the first,<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> and there is
hardly a copy of any of the old papers but has an advertisement for
some negro at large.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> These notices sometimes advise that the slave
has stolen from his master; often that he has a pass, and is pretending
to be a free negro; and occasionally that a free negro is suspected of
harboring him.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>The law against harboring was severe and was strictly enforced. Anyone
might take up a suspicious negro; while whoever returned a runaway to
his master was by law entitled to receive five shillings and expenses.
It was always the duty of the local authorities to apprehend suspects.
When this occurred the procedure was to lodge the negro in jail, and
advertise for the master, who might come, and after proving title and
paying costs, take him away. Otherwise the negro was sold<a id="Page_50" class="pagenum" title="50"></a> for a short
time to satisfy jail fees, advertised again, and finally either set at
liberty or disposed of as pleased the local court.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>This fleeing from service on the part of negro slaves, while varying
somewhat in frequency, was fairly constant during the whole slavery
period, increasing as the number of slaves grew larger. During
the British occupation of Philadelphia, however, it assumed such
enormous proportions that the number of negroes held there was
permanently lowered.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> Notwithstanding, then, the kindly treatment
they received, slaves in Pennsylvania ran away. Nevertheless it is
significant that during the same period white servants ran away more
than twice as often.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>Many traits of daily life and marks of personal appearance which no
historian has described, are preserved in the advertisements of the
daily papers. Almost every negro seems to have had the smallpox.
To have done with this and the measles was justly considered an
enhancement in value. Some of the negroes kidnapped from Africa
still bore traces of their savage ancestry. Not a few spoke several
languages. Gener<a id="Page_51" class="pagenum" title="51"></a>ally they were fond of gay dress. Some carried fiddles
when they ran away. One had made considerable money by playing. Many
little hints as to character appear. Thus Mona is full of flattery.
Cuff Dix is fond of liquor. James chews abundance of tobacco. Stephen
has a “sower countenance”; Harry, “meek countenance”; Rachel,
“remarkable austere countenance”; Dick is “much bandy legged”; Violet,
“pretty, lusty, and fat.” A likely negro wench is sold because of her
breeding fast. One negro says that he has been a preacher among the
Indians. Two others fought a duel with pistols. A hundred years has
involved no great change in character.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>Finally, on the basis of information drawn from rare and miscellaneous
sources it becomes apparent that in slavery times there was more
kindliness and intimacy between the races than existed afterwards. In
those days many slaves were treated as if part of the master’s family:
when sick they were nursed and cared for; when too old to work they
were provided for; and some were remembered in the master’s will.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
Negroes did run<a id="Page_52" class="pagenum" title="52"></a> away, and numbers of them desired to be free, but when
manumission came not a few of them preferred to stay with their former
owners. It was the opinion of an advocate of emancipation that they
were better off as slaves than they could possibly be as freemen.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>Such was slavery in Pennsylvania. If on the one hand there was the
chance of families being sold apart; if there was seen the cargo, the
slave-drove, the auction sale; it must be remembered that such things
are inseparable from the institution of slavery, and that on the
other hand they were rare, and not to be weighed against the positive
comfort and well-being of which there is such abundant proof. If ever
it be possible not to condemn modern slavery, it might seem that
slavery as it existed in Pennsylvania in the eighteenth century was a
good, probably for the masters, certainly for the<a id="Page_53" class="pagenum" title="53"></a> slaves.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> The
fact is that it existed in such mitigated form that it was impossible
for it to be perpetuated. Whenever men can treat their slaves as men
in Pennsylvania treated them, they are living in a moral atmosphere
inconsistent with the holding of slaves. Nothing can then preserve
slavery but paramount economic needs. In Pennsylvania, since such needs
were not paramount, slavery was doomed.</p>

<a id="CHAP_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="subtitle"><span class="smcap">The Breaking up of Slavery&mdash;Manumission.</span></p>


<p>In Pennsylvania the disintegration of slavery began as soon as slavery
was established, for there were free negroes in the colony at the
beginning of the eighteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> Manumission may have taken
place earlier than this, for in 1682 an owner made definite promise
of freedom to his negro.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> The first indisputable case now known,
however, occurred in 1701, when a certain Lydia Wade living in Chester
County freed her slaves by testament.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> In the same year William
Penn on his return to England liberated his blacks likewise.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>
Judging from the casual and unexpected references to free ne<a id="Page_55" class="pagenum" title="55"></a>groes
which come to light from time to time, it seems probable that other
masters also bestowed freedom. At any rate the status of the free negro
had come to be recognized about this time as one to be protected by
law, for when in 1703 Antonio Garcia, a Spanish mulatto, was brought
to Philadelphia as a slave, he appealed to the provincial Council,
and presently was set at liberty.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> In 1717 the records of Christ
Church mention Jane, a free negress, who was baptized there with her
daughter.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>This freeing of negroes at so early a time in the history of the colony
is sufficiently remarkable. It might be expected that manumission
would have been rare; and, indeed, the records are very few at first.
Nevertheless a law passed in 1725&ndash;1726 would indicate that the practice
was by no means unusual.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>It is not possible.to say what was the immediate cause of the passing
of that part of the act which refers to manumission. It may have been
the growth of a class of black freemen, or it may have been the desire
to check manumission;<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> but it was probably neither of these things
so much as it was the practice of masters who set free their infirm
slaves when the labor of those slaves was no longer remunerative.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>
This practice together with the usual shiftlessness of most of the
freedmen makes the resulting legislation intelligible enough. It<a id="Page_56" class="pagenum" title="56"></a>
provided that thereafter if any master purposed to set his negro free,
he should obligate himself at the county court to secure the locality
in which the negro might reside from any expense occasioned by the
sickness of the negro or by his inability to support himself. If a
negro received liberty by will, recognizance should be entered into by
the executor immediately. Without this no negro was to be deemed free.
The security was fixed at thirty pounds.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>Whatever may have been the full purpose of this statute, there can
be no question that it did check manumission to a certain extent. A
standing obligation of thirty pounds, which might at any moment become
an unpleasant reality, when added to the other sacrifices which freeing
a slave entailed, was probably sufficient to discourage many who
possessed mildly good intentions. Several times it was protested that
the amount was so excessive as to check the beneficence of owners:<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>
and on one occasion it was computed that the thirty pounds required
did not really suffice to support such negroes as became charges, but
that a different method and a smaller sum would have secured better
results.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> The<a id="Page_57" class="pagenum" title="57"></a> burden to owners was no doubt felt very grievously
during the latter half of the eighteenth century, when manumission was
going on so actively, and it is known that the Assembly was asked to
give relief.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> Nevertheless nothing was done until 1780 when the
abolition act swept from the statute-books all previous legislation
about the negro, slave as well as free.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>In spite of the obstacles created by the statute of 1725&ndash;1726, the
freeing of negroes continued. In 1731 John Baldwin of Chester ordered
in his will that his negress be freed one year after his decease. Two
years later Ralph Sandiford is said to have given liberty to all of
his slaves. In 1742 Judge Langhorne in Bucks County devised freedom
to all of his negroes, between thirty and forty in number. In 1744 by
the will of John Knowles of Oxford, negro James was to be made free
on condition that he gave security to the executors to pay the thirty
pounds if required. Somewhat before this time John Harris, the founder
of Harrisburg, set free the faithful negro Hercules, who had saved his
life from the Indians. In 1746 Samuel Blunson manumitted his slaves
at Columbia. During this period negroes were occasionally sent to the
Moravians, who gave them religious training, baptized them, and after
a time set them at liberty. During the following years the records of
some of the churches refer again and again to free negroes who were
married in them, bap<a id="Page_58" class="pagenum" title="58"></a>tized in them, or who brought their children to
them to be baptized.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> At an early date there was a sufficient
number of free black people in Pennsylvania to attract the attention of
philanthropists; and it is known that Whitefield as early as 1744 took
up a tract of land partly with the intention of making a settlement
of free negroes.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> Up to this time, however, manumission probably
went on in a desultory manner, hampered by the large security required,
and practised only by the most ardent believers in human liberty. The
middle of the eighteenth century marked a great turning-point.</p>

<p>The southeastern part of Pennsylvania, in which most of the negroes
were located, was peopled largely by Quakers, who in many localities
were the principal slave-owners, and who at different periods during
the eighteenth century probably held from a half to a third of all
the slaves in the colony. But they were never able to reconcile this
practice entirely with their religious belief and from the very
beginning it encountered strong opposition. As this opposition is
really part of the history of abolition in Pennsylvania it will be
treated at length in the following chapter. Here it is sufficient to
say that from 1688 a long warfare was carried on, for the most part by
zealous reformers who gradually won adherents, until about 1750 the
Friends’ meetings declared against slavery, and the members who were
not slave-owners undertook to persuade those who still owned negroes to
give them up.</p>

<p><a id="Page_59" class="pagenum" title="59"></a>
The feeling among some of the Friends was extraordinary at this time.
They went from one slaveholder to another expostulating, persuading,
entreating. It was then that the saintly John Woolman did his work;
but he was only the most distinguished among many others. It is hardly
possible to read over the records of any Friends’ meeting for the
next thirty years without finding numerous references to work of this
character; and in more than one journal of the period mention is made
of the obstacles encountered and the expedients employed.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>The results of their efforts were far-reaching. Many Friends who
would have scrupled to buy more slaves, and who were convinced that
slave-holding was an evil, yet retained such slaves as they had,
through motives of expediency, and also because they believed that
negroes held in mild bondage were better off than when free. Against
this temporizing policy the reformers fought hard, and aided by the
decision of the Yearly Meeting that slaveholders should no longer
participate in the affairs of the Society, carried forward their work
with such success that within one more generation slavery among the
Friends in Pennsylvania had passed away.</p>

<p>During the period, then, from 1750 to 1780 manumission among the
Friends became very frequent. Many slaves were set free outright,
their masters assuming the liability required by law. Others were
manumitted on condition that they would not become chargeable.<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>
Some owners gave promise of freedom at the end of a certain number of
years, considering the service during those years an equivalent for the
financial obligation<a id="Page_60" class="pagenum" title="60"></a> which at the end they would have to assume.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>
Often the negro was given his liberty on condition that at a future
time he would pay to the master his purchase price.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> In 1751 a
writer said that numerous negroes had gained conditional freedom, and
were wandering around the country in search of employment so as to pay
their owners. The magistrates of Philadelphia complained of this as a
nuisance.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>Just how many slaves gained their freedom during this period it is
impossible to say. The church records mention them again and again; and
they become, what they had not been before, the occasion of frequent
notice and serious speculation.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> Other people began now to follow
the Friends’ example,<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> and the belief in abstract principles of
freedom aroused by the Revolutionary struggle gave further impetus to
the movement.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> In every quarter, now, manumissions were constantly
be<a id="Page_61" class="pagenum" title="61"></a>ing made.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> Any estimate as to how many negroes, servants and
free, there were in Pennsylvania by 1780 must be largely a conjecture,
but it is perhaps safe to say that there were between four and five
thousand.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>The act of 1780, which put an end to the further growth of slavery in
Pennsylvania, marked the beginning of the final work of the liberators.
Coming at a time when so many people had given freedom to their slaves,
and passing with so little opposition in the Assembly as to show that
the majority of Pennsylvania’s people no longer had sympathy with
slavery, it was the signal to the abolitionists to urge the manumission
of such negroes as the law had left in bondage. The task was made
easier by the fact that not only was the value of the slave property
now much diminished, but a man no longer needed to enter into surety
when he set his slaves free. Doubtless many whose religious scruples
had been balanced by material considerations, now saw the way smooth
before them, or arranged to make the sacrifice cost them little or
nothing at all. During this period manumission took on a commercial
aspect which formerly had not been so evident. This was brought about
in several ways.</p>

<p>Sometimes negroes had saved enough to purchase their liberty.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>
Many, as before, received freedom upon<a id="Page_62" class="pagenum" title="62"></a> binding themselves to pay
for it at the expiration of a certain time.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> In this they often
received assistance from well-disposed people, in particular from the
Friends, who had by no means stopped the good work when their own
slaves were set free.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> At times the entire purchase money was paid
by some philanthropist.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> Frequently one member of a negro family
bought freedom for another, the husband often paying for his wife, the
father for his children.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> Furthermore it had now become common
to bind out negroes for a term of years, and many owners who desired
their slaves to be free, found partial compensation in selling them
for a limited period, on express condition that all servitude should
be terminated strictly in accordance with the contract. By<a id="Page_63" class="pagenum" title="63"></a> furthering
such transactions the benevolent tried to help negroes to gain
freedom.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> Occasionally the slave liberated was bound for a term of
years to serve the former master.<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> Even at this period, however,
negroes continued to be manumitted from motives of pure benevolence.
Some received liberty by the master’s testament, and others were held
only until assurance was given the master that he would not become
liable under the poor law.<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p>As the result of the earnest efforts that were made slavery in
Pennsylvania dwindled steadily. In the course of a long time it would
doubtless have passed away as the result of continued individual
manumission. As a matter of fact, it had become almost extinct within
two generations after 1750. This was brought about by work that
affected not individuals, but whole classes, and finally all the people
of the state; which was designed to strike at the root of slavery and
destroy it altogether. This was abolition.</p>

<a id="CHAP_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="subtitle"><span class="smcap">The Destruction of Slavery&mdash;Abolition.</span></p>


<p>The events which led to the extinction of slavery in Pennsylvania fall
naturally into four periods. They are, first, the years from 1682 to
about 1740, during which the Germans discountenanced slave-holding, and
the Friends ceased importing negroes; second, the period of the Quaker
abolitionists, from about 1710 to 1780, by which time slavery among
the Quakers had come to an end; third, from 1780 to 1788, the years of
legislative action; and finally, the period from 1788 to the time when
slavery in Pennsylvania became extinct through the gradual working of
the act for abolition.</p>

<p>Opposition to slaveholding arose among the Friends. Slavery had not
yet been recognized in statute law when they began to protest against
it. This protest, faint in the beginning and taken up only by a few
idealists, was never stopped afterwards, but, growing continually in
strength, was, as the events of after years showed, from the first
fraught with foreboding of doom to the institution. Opposition on
the part of the Friends had begun before Pennsylvania was founded.
In 1671 Fox, travelling in the West Indies, advised his brethren in
Barbadoes to deal mildly with their negroes, and after certain years of
servitude to make them free. Four years later William Edmundson in one
of his letters asked how it was possible for men to reconcile Christ’s
command, to do as they would be done by, with the prac<a id="Page_65" class="pagenum" title="65"></a>tice of holding
slaves without hope or expectation of freedom.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> Nevertheless in
the first years after the settlement of Pennsylvania Friends were the
principal slaveholders. This led to differences of opinion, but at the
start economic considerations prevailed.</p>

<p>The reform really began in 1688, a year memorable for the first formal
protest against slavery in North America.<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> Germantown had been
settled by German refugees who in religious belief were Friends. These
men, simple-minded and honest, having had no previous acquaintance with
slavery, were amazed to find it existing in Penn’s colony. At their
monthly meeting, the eighteenth of the second month, 1688, Pastorius
and other leaders drew up an eloquent and touching memorial. In words
of surpassing nobleness and simplicity they stated the reasons why they
were against slavery and the traffic in men’s bodies. Would the masters
wish so to be dealt with? Was it possible for this to be in accord with
Christianity? In Pennsylvania there was freedom of conscience; there
ought likewise to be freedom of the body. What report would it cause
in Europe that in this new land the Quakers handled men as there men
treated their cattle? If it were possible that Christian men might do
these things they desired to be so informed.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>

<a id="Page_66" class="pagenum" title="66"></a></p>

<p>This protest they sent to the Monthly Meeting at Richard Worrel’s.
There it was considered, and found too weighty to be dealt with, and
so it was sent on to the Quarterly Meeting at Philadelphia, and from
thence to the Yearly Meeting at Burlington, which finally decided not
to give a positive judgment in the case.<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> For the present nothing
came of it; but the idea did not die. It probably lingered in the minds
of many men; for within a few years a sentiment had been aroused which
became widespread and powerful.</p>

<p>In 1693 George Keith, leader of a dissenting faction of Quakers, laid
down as one of his doctrines that negroes were men, and that slavery
was contrary to the religion of Christ; also that masters should set
their negroes at liberty after some reasonable time.<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> At a meeting
of Friends held in Philadelphia in 1693 the prevailing opinion was that
none should buy except to set free. Three years later at the Friends’
Yearly Meeting it was resolved to discourage the further bringing in of
slaves.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> In 1712 when the Yearly Meeting at Philadelphia desiring
counsel applied to the Yearly Meeting at London, it received answer
that the multiplying of negroes might be of dangerous consequence.<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>
In the next and the following years the Meetings strongly advised
Friends not to import and not to buy slaves.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> From 1730 to 1737
reports showed that the importation of<a id="Page_67" class="pagenum" title="67"></a> negroes by Friends was being
largely discontinued. By 1745 it had virtually ceased.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>It is generally believed that Pennsylvania’s restrictive legislation,
that long series of acts passed for the purpose of keeping out negroes
by means of prohibitive duties, was largely due to Quaker influence.
This is probably true, but it is not easy to prove. The proceedings of
the colonial Assembly have been reported so briefly that they do not
give the needed information. When, however, the strong feeling of the
Friends is understood in connection with the fact that they controlled
the early legislatures, it is not hard to believe that the high duties
were imposed because they wished the traffic at an end. Their feeling
about the slave-trade and their desire to stop it are revealed again
and again in the meeting minutes.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> The most drastic law was
certainly due to them.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p><a class="pagenum" id="Page_68" title="68"></a>
But the small number of negroes in Pennsylvania as compared with the
neighboring northern colonies was above all due to the early and
continuous aversion to slavery manifested by the Germans. The first
German settlers opposed the institution for religious reasons.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>
This opposition is perhaps to be ascribed to them as Quakers rather
than as men of a particular race. But as successive swarms poured into
the country it was found, it may be from religious scruples, more
probably because of peculiar economic characteristics and because of
feelings of sturdy industry and self-reliance, that they almost never
bought negroes nor even hired them.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> As the German element in
Pennsylvania was<a id="Page_69" class="pagenum" title="69"></a> very considerable, amounting at times to one-third of
the population, such a course, though lacking in dramatic quality, and
though it has been unheralded by the historians, was nevertheless of
immense and decisive importance.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>During this period, then, much had been accomplished. Not only had the
Germans turned their backs upon slave-holding, but the Friends, brought
to perceive the iniquity of the practice, had ceased importing slaves,
and for the most part had ceased buying them. It was another generation
before the conservative element could be brought to advance beyond
this position. It was not so easy to make them give up the slaves they
already had.</p>

<p>The succeeding period was characterized by an inevitable struggle which
ensued between considerations of economy and ethics. The attitude of
many Friends was that in refusing to buy any more slaves they were<a id="Page_70" class="pagenum" title="70"></a>
fulfilling all reasonable obligations. Sometimes there was a desire
to hush up the whole matter and get it out of mind. Isaac Norris
tells of a meeting that was large and comfortable, where the business
would have gone very well but for the warm pushing by some Friends
of Chester in the matter of negroes. But he adds that affairs were
so managed that the unpleasant subject was dropped.<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> What would
have been the result of this disposition cannot now be known; but it
proved impossible to smooth matters away. There had already begun
an age of reformers, forerunners by a hundred years of Garrison and
his associates, men who were content with nothing less than entire
abolition.</p>

<p>The first of the abolitionists was William Southeby of Maryland, who
went to Pennsylvania. For years the subject of slavery weighed heavily
upon his mind. As early as 1696 he urged the Meeting to take action.
His petition to the Provincial Assembly in 1712 asking that all slaves
be set free was one of the most memorable incidents in the early
struggle against slavery. But the Assembly resolved that his project
was neither just nor convenient; and his ideas were so far in advance
of the times that not only did he a little later lose favor among the
Friends, but long after it was the judgment that his ill-regulated zeal
had brought only sorrow.<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>

<a id="Page_71" class="pagenum" title="71"></a></p>

<p>The next in point of time was Ralph Sandiford (1693&ndash;1733), a Friend of
Philadelphia. His hostility to slavery was aroused by the sufferings
of negroes whom he had seen in the West Indies; and his feeling was
so strong that on one occasion he refused to accept a gift from a
slaveholder. In 1729 he published his <cite>Mystery of Iniquity</cite>, an
impassioned protest against slavery. Although threatened with severe
penalties if he circulated this work, he distributed it wherever he
felt that it would be of use.<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> Such enmity did he arouse that he
was forced to leave the city.<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>His work was carried forward by Benjamin Lay (1677&ndash;1759), an Englishman
who came from Barbadoes to Philadelphia in 1731. He too aroused much
hostility by his violence of expression and eccentric efforts to create
pity for the slaves. He gave his whole life to the cause, but owing to
his too radical methods he was much less influential than he might have
been.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p>A man of far greater power was John Woolman (1720&ndash;1772), perhaps the
greatest liberator that the Friends ever produced. Woolman gave up his
position as accountant rather than write bills for the sale of negroes.
He was very religious, and most of his life he spent as a minister
travelling from one colony to another trying to persuade men of the
wickedness of<a id="Page_72" class="pagenum" title="72"></a> slavery. In 1754 he published the first part of his
book, <cite>Some Considerations on the Keeping of Negroes</cite>, of which the
second part appeared in 1762. He was stricken with smallpox while on a
visit to England, and died there.<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p>

<p>The last was Anthony Benezet (1713&ndash;1784), a French Huguenot who joined
the Society of Friends. He came to Philadelphia as early as 1731, but
it was about 1750 that his attention was drawn to the negroes. From
that time to the end of his life he was their zealous advocate. By his
writings upon Africa, slavery, and the slave-trade, he attracted the
attention and enlisted the support of many. He was untiring in his
efforts. Frequently he talked with the negroes and strove to improve
them; he endeavored to create a favorable impression of them; he was
influential in securing the passage of the abolition act; and at his
death he bequeathed the bulk of his property to the cause which he had
served so well in his life.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>That these Quaker reformers, particularly men like Woolman and Benezet,
exerted an enormous influence against slavery in Pennsylvania,
there can be no doubt.<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> Their influence is attested by numerous
contemporary allusions, but it is proved far better by the change in
sentiment which was gradually brought about. Southeby, Sandiford, and
Lay were before their time and were<a id="Page_73" class="pagenum" title="73"></a> treated as fanatics. Woolman and
Benezet who came afterward were able to reap the harvest which had been
sown.</p>

<p>The movement which had been urged with violent rapidity from without
was all the while proceeding slowly and quietly within. For many years
the Friends considered slavery, and almost every year the Meetings
made reports upon the subject. These reports showed that the number of
Quakers who bought slaves was constantly decreasing.<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> In 1743 an
annual query was instituted.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> In 1754 the Yearly Meeting circulated
a printed letter strongly condemning slavery.<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> The second decisive
step followed when it was made a rule that Friends who persisted in
buying slaves should be disowned. The measure was effective and this
part of the work was soon accomplished.<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> Finally in 1758 the third
step was taken when it was unanimously agreed that Friends should
be advised to manumit their slaves, and that those who persisted in
holding them should not<a id="Page_74" class="pagenum" title="74"></a> be allowed to participate in the affairs of
the Society.<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> John Woolman and others were appointed on committees
to visit slaveholders and persuade them.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p>The work of these visiting committees is as remarkable as any in the
history of slavery. Self-sacrificing people who had freed their own
slaves now abandoned their interests and set out to persuade others
to give negroes the freedom thought to be due them. In southeastern
Pennsylvania are old diaries almost untouched for a century and a half
which bear witness of characters odd and heroic; which contain the
story of men and women sincere, brave, and unfaltering, who united
quiet mysticism with the zeal of a crusader. The committees undertook
to persuade a whole population to give up its slaves. There is no doubt
that the task was a difficult one. Again and again the writers speak
of obstacles overcome. They tell of owners who would not be convinced,
who acknowledged that slavery was wrong, and promised that they would
buy no more slaves, but who affirmed that they would keep such as they
had. The diaries speak of repeated visits, of the<a id="Page_75" class="pagenum" title="75"></a> arguments employed,
of slow and gradual yielding, and of final triumph. If ever Christian
work was carried on in the spirit of Christ, it was when John Woolman,
Isaac Jackson, James Moon, and their fellow missionaries put an end to
slavery among the Quakers of Pennsylvania.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p>The penalties denounced by the Meeting were imposed with firmness.
In 1761 the Chester Quarterly Meeting dealt with a member for having
bought and sold a slave.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> Through this and the following years
there are many records in the Monthly Meetings of manumissions,
voluntary and persuaded; record being made in each case to ensure the
negro his freedom.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> In 1774 the Philadelphia Meeting resolved that
Friends who held slaves beyond the age at which white apprentices were
discharged, should be treated as disorderly persons.<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> The work of
abolition was practically completed in 1776 when the resolution passed
that members who persisted in holding slaves were to be<a id="Page_76" class="pagenum" title="76"></a> disowned.<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>
If this is understood in connection with the fact that in the Meetings
questions were rarely decided except by almost unanimous vote, it is
clear that so far as the Friends were concerned slavery was nearly
extinct. This was almost absolutely accomplished by 1780.<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p>The wholesale private abolition of slavery by the Friends of
Pennsylvania is one of those occurrences over which the historian
may well linger. It was not delayed until slavery had become
unprofitable,<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> nor was it forced through any violent hostility.
It was a result attained merely by calm, steady persuasion, and a
disposition to obey the dictates of conscience unflinchingly. As such
it is among the grandest examples of the triumph of principle and ideal
righteousness over self-interest.<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> It may well be doubted whether
any body of<a id="Page_77" class="pagenum" title="77"></a> men and women other than the Friends were capable of such
conduct at this time.<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<p>So far the checking of slavery in Pennsylvania had been the result of
two great factors; that the Germans would not hold slaves, and that the
Friends gradually gave them up. Another factor now made it possible
to bring about the end of the institution altogether. There began the
period of the long contest of the Revolution, when Pennsylvania was
stirred to its depths by the struggle for independence.</p>

<p>Almost at the beginning of the war, in 1776, the Assembly received
from citizens of Philadelphia two petitions that manumission be
rendered easier. These petitions accomplished nothing,<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> but the
feeling which had been gathering strength for so many years went
forward unchecked, and by 1778 there existed a powerful sentiment
in favor of legislative abolition. Therefore in February, 1779, the
draft of a bill was prepared and recommended by the Council; but for
a while no progress was made, since the Assembly, though it approved
the principle, believed that such a measure should originate in
itself.<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> Toward the end of the year the matter was taken up in
earnest, and a bill was soon drafted. Public sentiment was thoroughly
aroused now. Petitions for and against the bill came to the Assembly,
and letters were published in the newspapers. The friends of the
measure were untiring in their efforts. Anthony Benezet is said to have
visited every member of the As<a class="pagenum" id="Page_78" title="78"></a>sembly. On March 1, 1780, the bill was
enacted into a law, thirty-four yeas and twenty-one nays.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p>The “Act for the gradual Abolition of Slavery” provided that thereafter
no child born in Pennsylvania should be a slave; but that such
children, if negroes or mulattoes born of a slave mother, should be
servants until they were twenty-eight years of age; that all present
slaves should be registered by their masters before November 1, 1780;
and that such as were not then registered should be free.<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> It
abolished the old discrimina<a id="Page_79" class="pagenum" title="79"></a>tions, for it provided that negroes
whether slave or free should be tried and punished in the same manner
as white people, except that a slave was not to be admitted to
witness against a freeman.<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> The earlier special legislation was
repealed.<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p>The act of 1780, which was principally the work of George Bryan,<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>
was the final, decisive step in the destruction of slavery in
Pennsylvania. The buying and selling of human beings as chattels
had become repugnant to the best thought of the state, and it had
partly passed away. The practice still survived, however, in many
quarters, and strengthened as it was by considerations of economy and
convenience, it would probably have gone on for many years. Against
this the abolition law struck a mortal blow. From the day of March 1,
1780, the little remnant of slavery slowly withered and passed away.
In the course of a generation, except for some scattered cases, it had
vanished altogether.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania was the first state to pass an abolition law.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> In
after years this became a matter of great<a id="Page_80" class="pagenum" title="80"></a> pride. Her legislators and
statesmen frequently boasted of it. Not only was the priority a glory
in itself, but the manner in which Pennsylvania conceived the law, and
the success with which she carried it out, furnished the states that
lay near her a splendid example and a strong incentive which not a few
of them followed shortly thereafter.<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<p>Yet this law was open to some objections, and for different reasons
received much criticism. First, it was loosely and obscurely drawn in
some of its sections, and these gave rise to litigation.<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> In the
second place, it was largely ineffectual to prevent certain abuses
which had been foreseen when it was discussed, and which assumed
alarming proportions in a few years. Some Pennsylvanians openly kept up
the slave-trade outside of Pennsylvania, and masters within the state
sold their slaves into neighboring states, whither they sent also their
young negroes, who there remained slaves instead of acquiring freedom
at twenty-eight.<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> They even sent away for short periods their
female slaves when pregnant, so that the children might not be born on
the free soil of Pennsylvania. Besides this<a id="Page_81" class="pagenum" title="81"></a> the kidnapping of free
negroes went on unchecked.<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p>These practices did not escape unprotested. The Friends were
indefatigable in their efforts to stop them, and the government was
not disposed to allow the work of 1780 to be undone.<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> So in 1788
was passed an act to explain and enforce the previous one. It provided
that the births of the children of slaves were to be registered; that
husband and wife were not to be separated more than ten miles without
their consent; that pregnant females should not be sent out of the
state pending their delivery; and it forbade the slave-trade under
penalty of one thousand pounds. Heavy punishments were provided for
such chicanery as had previously been employed.<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

<p>This legislation was enforced by the courts in constructions which
favored freedom wherever possible. Exact justice was dealt out, but
if the master had neglected in the smallest degree to comply with the
precise conditions specified in the laws, whether through carelessness,
mistake, or unavoidable circumstance, the authorities generally
showed themselves glad to declare the slave free.<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> The Friends
and abolitionists were particularly active in hunting up pretexts
and instituting<a id="Page_82" class="pagenum" title="82"></a> law-suits for the purpose of setting at liberty the
negroes of people who believed they were obeying the laws, but who had
neglected to comply with some technical point.<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p>While these devotees of freedom were harassing the enemy they were
engaged in operations much more drastic. The laws for abolition,
respecting as they did the sacredness of right in property, had not
abrogated existing titles to slaves.<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> This the abolitionists
denounced as theft, and resolved to get justice by cutting out slavery
root and branch.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>First they attacked it in the courts. The declaration of rights in the
constitution of 1790 declared that all men were born equally free and
independent, and had an inherent right to enjoy and defend life and
liberty.<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> In 1792 a committee of the House refused the petition of
some slaveholders on the ground that slavery was not only unlawful in
itself, but also repugnant to the constitution.<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> This point was
seized upon by the abolitionists, who resolved to test it before the
law. Accordingly they arranged the famous case of Negro Flora <em>v.</em>
Joseph Graisberry, and brought it up to the Supreme Court of the state
in 1795. It was not settled there, but went up to what was at that
time the ultimate judicial authority in Pennsylvania, the High Court
of Errors and Appeals. Some seven years after the question had first
been brought to law this august tribunal de<a id="Page_83" class="pagenum" title="83"></a>cided after lengthy and
able argument that negro slavery did legally exist before the adoption
of the constitution of 1790, and that it had not been abolished
thereby.<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<p>Failing to destroy slavery in the courts the abolitionists strove to
demolish it by legal enactment. For this purpose they began a campaign
that lasted for two generations. In 1793 the Friends petitioned the
Senate for the complete abolition of slavery, and in 1799 they sent a
memorial showing their deep concern at the keeping of slaves. In the
following year citizens of Philadelphia prayed for abolition, and a few
days later the free blacks of the city petitioned that their brethren
in bondage be set free, suggesting that a tax be laid upon themselves
to help compensate the masters dispossessed. The demand for freedom
was supported in other quarters of the state, and undoubtedly a strong
feeling was aroused. The Pennsylvania Society for the Abolition of
Slavery began the practice, which it kept up for so many years, of
regularly memorializing the legislature. Later on some of the leading
men of the state took up the cause, and once the governor in his
message referred to the galling yoke of slavery and its stain upon the
commonwealth.<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>

<a id="Page_84" class="pagenum" title="84"></a></p>

<p>It is probable, however, that the majority of the people in the state
believed that enough had been done, and desired to see the little
remaining slavery quietly extinguished by the operation of such laws
as were effecting the extinction. Be this as it may, it is certain
that although many bills were proposed to effect total and immediate
abolition, some of which had good prospects of success, yet each one
was gradually pared of its most radical provisions, and in the end was
always found to lack the support requisite to make it a law.</p>

<p>In 1797 the House had a resolution offered and a bill prepared for
abolition. This measure dragged along through the next two sessions,
but in 1800 so much encouragement came from the city and counties that
the work was carried on in earnest. The course of this bill illustrates
the progress of others. At first the proposed enfranchisement was to
be immediate and for all; then it was modified to affect only negroes
over twenty-eight. In this form it passed the House by a handsome
majority, but in the Senate it was postponed to the next session. When
finally its time came the committee having it in charge reported that
as slavery was not in accordance with the constitution of 1790, a law
to do away with slavery was not needed. The measure was still mentioned
as unfinished business about the time that the High Court decided that
slavery was in accordance with the constitution after all.<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<p>The abolitionists did not lose heart. They tried again in 1803, and
again the following year. In 1811 a little<a id="Page_85" class="pagenum" title="85"></a> was done in the House,
and in 1821 the matter was discussed in the Senate. In this latter
year a bill was prepared and debated, but nothing passed except the
motion to postpone indefinitely. Indeed the movement had now spent its
force, and was thereafter confined to futile petitions that showed more
earnestness of purpose than expectation of success.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p>This is easily explicable when it is understood how rapidly slavery
had declined. The number of slaves in Pennsylvania had never been
large. By the first Federal census they were put at less than four
thousand; but within a decade they had diminished by more than half,
and ten years later there were only a few hundred scattered throughout
the state.<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> The majority of these slaves during the later years
were living in the western counties that bordered on Maryland and
Virginia, where slavery had begun latest and lingered longest.<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a><a id="Page_86" class="pagenum" title="86"></a> In
Philadelphia and the older counties it had almost entirely disappeared.
So rapid was the decline that as early as 1805 the Pennsylvania
Abolition Society reported that in the future it would devote itself
less to seeking the liberation of negroes than to striving to improve
those already free. This could only mean that they were finding very
few to liberate.<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<p>That the decreasing agitation for the entire abolition of slavery in
Pennsylvania was due to the decline of slavery and not to any decrease
in hostility to it, is shown by the character of other legislation
demanded, and the readiness with which stringent laws were passed.
The act of 1780 permitted the resident of another state to bring his
slave into Pennsylvania and keep him there for six months.<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> A very
strong feeling developed against this. In 1795 it was necessary for the
Supreme Court to declare that such a right was valid. It was afterwards
decided, however, that if the master continued to take his slave in
and out of Pennsylvania for short periods, the slave should be free.
Again and again the legislature was asked to withdraw the privilege.
It is needless to recount the petitions that never ceased to come,
and at times poured in like a flood. At last the pressure of popular
feeling could no longer be held back, and after the legislation of
1847 following the memorable case of Prigg <em>v.</em> Pennsylvania, when a
slave was brought by his master within the bounds of Pennsylvania, that
moment by state law he was free.<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

<p><a id="Page_87" class="pagenum" title="87"></a>
Long before this time the passage through the state of slaves bound
with chains had awakened the pity of those who saw it.<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> In 1816 it
was decided that in certain cases if a runaway slave gave birth to a
child in Pennsylvania the child was free.<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> Later the legislature
forbade state officers to give any assistance in returning fugitives;
and at last lacked but little of giving fugitives trial by jury.</p>

<p>If it be asked whether at this time Pennsylvania was not rather
decrying slavery among her neighbors than destroying it within her own
gates, since beyond denial she still had slavery there, it must be
answered that first, her slavery as regards magnitude was a veritable
mote, and secondly, since after 1830, for example, there was not
one slave in Pennsylvania under fifty years old, it was far more to
the advantage of the negroes to remain in servitude where the law
guaranteed them protection and good treatment, than to be set free,
when their color and their declining years would have rendered their
well-being doubtful. It is probable that such slavery as existed there
in the last years was based rather on the kindness of the master
and the devotion of the slave, than on the power of the one and the
suffering of the other. It was a peaceful passing away.<a class="pagenum" id="Page_88" title="88"></a> And so in
connection with slavery Pennsylvania is seen to have been fortunate.
Seeing at an early time the pernicious consequences of such an
institution she was able, such were the circumstances of her economic
environment, and such was the character of her people, to check it so
effectually that it never assumed threatening bulk. Almost as quick
to perceive the evil of it, she acted, and while others moralized and
lamented, she set her slaves free. Moreover as if to atone for the
sin of slave-keeping she granted her freedmen such privileges that it
seemed to her ardent idealists that the future could not but promise
well.</p>

<p>Whether this liberality came to be a matter of regret in after
years, and whether because of circumstances sure to come, but as yet
unforeseen, it was possible for the experience of Pennsylvania with her
free black population to be as happy as that with her slaves, it will
be the purpose of later chapters to enquire.</p>

       (“The Condition of Labor in Early Pennsylvania, I. Slavery,”
       in <cite>The Manufacturer</cite>, Feb. 2, 1891, p. 8) considers
       these laws to have been restrictive in purpose, and gives
       three causes for their passage, in the following order of
       importance: (a) dread of slave insurrections, (b) opposition
       of the free laboring classes to slave competition, (c)
       conscientious objections. I cannot think that this is correct.
       (a) seems to have been the impelling motive only in connection
       with the law of 1712, and seems rarely to have been thought
       of. It was urged in 1740, 1741, and 1742, when efforts were
       being made to pass a militia law in Pennsylvania, but it

1700. 20 shillings for negroes over sixteen years of age, 6
       for those under sixteen. No cause given. Apparently (terms
       of the act) <em>revenue</em>.&mdash;1705&ndash;1706. 40 shillings&mdash;a draw-back
       of one half if the negro be re-exported within six months.

       imported by immigrants for their own use, and not sold within
       a year. Almost certainly (preamble) <em>revenue.</em>&mdash;1712. 20
       pounds. The causes were a dread of insurrection because of
       the negro uprising in New York, and the Indians’ dislike
       of the importation of Indian slaves. Purpose undoubtedly

       because since 1712 none of the laws had been allowed to

In 1708 the Board of Trade requested the governor of
       Pennsylvania that very definite information on a variety of
       subjects relating to the negro be transmitted thereafter half
       yearly. Were these records available they would be worth more
       than all the remaining information. <em>Cf.</em> MS. Provincial

       the Black about five Thousand.” Col. Hart’s Answer, etc., MS.

       Household Servants in the City of Philadelphia” ... Letter

       communication gave the true state of the case, if not the
       exact numbers. “This Government has not hitherto had Occasion

Throughout this work the fundamental distinction between the

The rearing of slave children was regarded as a burden by
       owners. A writer declared that in Pennsylvania “negroes just
       born are considered an incumbrance only, and if humanity did
       not forbid it, they would be instantly given away.” <cite>Pa.
       Packet</cite>, Jan. 1, 1780. In 1732 the Philadelphia Court of
       Common Pleas ordered a man to take back a negress whom he had
       sold, and who proved to be pregnant. He was to refund the
       purchase money and the money spent “for Phisic and Attendance
       of the Said Negroe in her Miserable Condition.” MS. Court
       Papers. 1732&ndash;1744. Phila. Co., June 9, 1732.</p>

The Roman doctrine of <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">partus sequitur ventrem</em>. This was
       never established by law in Pennsylvania, and during colonial
       times was never the subject of a court decision that has come
       down. That it was the usage, however, there is abundant proof.
       In 1727 Isaac Warner bequeathed “To Wife Ann ... a negro woman
       named Sarah ... To daughter Ann Warner (3) an unborn negro
       child of the above named Sarah.” MS. Phila. Co. Will Files,
       no. 47, 1727. In 1786 the Supreme Court declared that it was
       the law of Pennsylvania, and had always been the custom. 1

       Will of Samuel Richardson of Philadelphia in <cite>Pa. Mag.</cite>,
       XXXIII, 373 (1719). In 1682 the attorney-general in England
       answering an inquiry from Jamaica, declared “That where goods
       or merchandise are by Law forfeited to the King, the sale of
       them from one to another will not fix the property as against
       the King, but they may be seized wherever found whilst they
       remain in specie; And that Negros being admitted Merchandise
       will fall within the same Law”. MS. Board of Trade Journals,
       IV, 124. On several occasions during war negro slaves were
       captured from the enemy and brought to Pennsylvania, where
       they were sold as ordinary prize-goods&mdash;things. In 1745,
       however, when two French negro prisoners produced papers
       showing that they were free, they were held for exchange as
       prisoners of war&mdash;persons. MS. Provincial Papers, VII, Oct.

<cite>Stat. at L.</cite>, X, 72. What was the standing of negro slaves
       before the ordinary courts of Pennsylvania in the years
       between 1700 and 1780 it is difficult to say. They certainly
       could not be witnesses&mdash;not against white men, since this
       privilege was given to free negroes for the first time in 1780
       (<cite>Stat. at L.</cite>, X, 70), and to slaves not until 1847 (<cite>Laws of
       Assembly, 1847</cite>, p. 208); while if they were witnesses against
       other negroes it would be before special courts. Doubtless
       negroes could sometimes seek redress in the ordinary courts,
       though naturally the number of such cases would be limited.
       There is, however, at least one instance of a white man being
       sued by a negro, who won his suit. “Francis Jn<sup>o</sup>son the Negro
       verbally complained agst W<sup>m</sup> Orion ... and after pleading to
       on both sides the Court passed Judgment and ordered W<sup>m</sup> Orion
       to pay him the sd Francis Jn<sup>o</sup>son twenty shillings” ... MS.
       Ancient Records of Sussex County, 1681 to 1709, 4th mo., 1687.
       Before 1700 negroes were tried before the ordinary courts, and
       there is at least one case where a negro witnessed against a
       white man. <em>Ibid.</em>, 8br 1687.</p>

       two negroes condemned to death for burglary, <em>ibid.</em>, IX, 6,
       also 699. The punishment for the attempted rape of a white
       woman was the one point that caused the disapproval of the
       attorney-general in England, and, probably, led to the passage
       of the revised act in 1705&ndash;1706. <em>Cf.</em> MS. Board of Trade
       Papers, Prop., VIII, 40, Bb. For restitution by masters, which

       penalty for robbery and burglary became imprisonment. This
       bore entirely on the master, so that in 1790 Governor Mifflin
       asked that corporal punishment be substituted. <cite>Hazard’s

Kalm (1748) said that there was no record of such a sentence
       being carried out; but he adds that a case having arisen, even
       the magistrates secretly advised the guilty person to leave
       the country, “as otherwise they could not avoid taking him
       prisoner, and then he would be condemned to die according to
       the laws of the country, without any hopes of saving him”.

       bill failed because stable marriage relations have always
       been found incompatible with the ready movement and transfer
       of slave property; and because at this early period the
       slaveholders recognized this fact, and were not yet disposed

       from the labor of adult free negroes, and that the public

       he endeavored to prove that a sum of about five shillings

       negro’s life after he was twenty-one, would amply suffice for
       all requirements. Pp. 8&ndash;14 of the second part, entitled “An

A MS. dated Phila., 1769, contains a list of persons who had
       promised to contribute towards purchasing a negro’s freedom.
       Among the memoranda are: “John Head agrees to give him Twenty
       Shillings and not to be Repaid ... John Benezet twenty
       Shillings ... Christopher Marshall /7/6.... If he can raise
       with my Donation enough to free him I agree to give him three

In 1779 a negro of Bucks County to secure the freedom of his
       wife gave his note to be paid by 1783. In 1782, having paid
       part, he was allowed to take his wife until the next payment.
       In 1785 she was free. MS. Rec. Pa. Soc. Abol. Sl., I, 27&ndash;43.
       In 1787 negro Samson had purchased his wife and children for
       ninety-nine pounds. <em>Ibid.</em>, I, 67. James Oronogue, who had
       been hired by his master to the keeper of a tavern, gained by
       his obliging behavior sixty pounds from the customers within
       four years’ time, and at his master’s death was allowed to
       purchase his freedom for one hundred pounds. He paid besides
       fifty pounds for his wife. <em>Ibid.</em>, I, 69. When Cuff Douglas
       had been a slave for thirty-seven years his master promised
       him freedom after four years more. On the master agreeing to
       take thirty pounds in lieu of this service, Douglas hired
       himself out, and was free at the end of sixteen months. He
       then began business as a tailor, and presently was able to buy
       his wife and children for ninety pounds, besides one son for
       whom he paid forty-five pounds. <em>Ibid.</em>, I, 72. Also <em>ibid.</em>,

“We also kindly received your advice about negro slaves, and
       we are one with you, that the multiplying of them, may be of
       a dangerous consequence, and therefore a Law was made in
       Pennsylvania laying Twenty pounds Duty upon every one imported
       there, which Law the Queen was pleas’d to disanull, we would
       heartily wish that a way might be found to stop the bringing
       in more here, or at least that Friends may be less concerned
       in buying or selling, of any that may be brought in, and hope
       for your assistance with the Government if any farther Law
       should be made discouraging the importation. We know not of
       any Friend amongst us that has any hand or concern in bringing
       any out of their own Country.” MS. Yearly M. M., 22 7th mo.,

“The Germans seldom hire men to work upon their farms.” Rush,
       <cite>An Account of the Manners of the German Inhabitants of
       Pennsylvania</cite> (1789), 24. “They never, as a general thing,
       had colored servants or slaves.” <em>Ibid.</em>, 24 (note by Rupp).
       “Slaves in Pennsylvania never were as numerous in proportion
       to the white population as in New York and New Jersey. To our
       German population this is certainly attributable&mdash;Wherever
       they or their numerous descendants located they preferred
       <em>their own</em> labor to that of negro slaves.” Buck, MS. <cite>History
       of Bucks County</cite>, 69. “Of all the nations who have settled in
       America, the Germans have availed themselves the least of the
       unjust and demoralizing aid of slavery.” W. Grimshaw, <cite>History
       of the United States</cite>, 79. The truth of these statements is
       revealed in the tax-lists of the different counties. Thus,
       in Berks County there were 2692 German tax-payers (61%) and
       1724 (39%) not Germans. Of these 44 Germans held 62 slaves,
       and 57 of other nationalities held 92 slaves. 3 <cite>Pa. Arch.</cite>,
       XVIII, 303&ndash;430. In York County, where there were 2051 German
       property-holders (34%) and 3993 who were not Germans (66%),
       27 Germans held 44 slaves as against 178 others who held 319
       slaves. 3 <cite>Pa. Arch.</cite>, XXI, 165&ndash;324. (Both these estimates are
       for 1780.) In Lancaster County the property-holders included
       approximately 3475 Germans (48%) and 3706 not Germans (52%).
       Here 31 Germans held 46 slaves, while 200 not Germans held 402
       slaves. 3 <cite>Pa. Arch.</cite>, XVII, 489&ndash;685 (1779). The records of
       the German churches rarely mention slaves.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_213" href="#FNanchor_213"><span class="label">[213]</span></a>
The small number of negroes in Pennsylvania was often
       noticed. Burnaby, <cite>Travels through the Middle Settlements</cite>,
       63, said “there are few negroes or slaves” ... (1759),
       Anburey, <cite>Travels through the Interior Parts of America</cite>, II,
       280&ndash;281, said, “The Pennsylvanians ... are more industrious
       of themselves, having but few blacks among them.” (1778).
       <em>Cf.</em> Proud, <cite>History</cite>, II, 274. Estimates as to the number
       of Germans in Pennsylvania vary from 3/5 (1747, <em>cf.</em> Rupp’s
       note in Rush, <cite>Account</cite>, 1) to 1/3 (1789, <em>ibid.</em>, 54). For
       many estimates <em>cf.</em> Diffenderffer, <cite>German Immigration into
       Pennsylvania</cite>, pt. II, <cite>The Redemptioners</cite>, 99&ndash;108. Some few
       Germans had intended to hold slaves from the first. <em>Cf.</em> the
       articles of agreement between the members of the Frankfort
       Company (1686): ... “alle ... leibeigenen Menschen ... sollen

In the absence of a plantation system slavery in Pennsylvania
       never was profitable in the same sense as in Virginia or South
       Carolina, and where white labor could be obtained slavery
       could not compete. <em>Cf.</em> Franklin, <cite>Works</cite>, II, 314, 315
       (1751). But as it was almost impossible to obtain sufficient
       white labor, or at least to retain it, slavery as it existed
       in Pennsylvania was profitable throughout the colonial period.

This is my judgment after a careful investigation of the
       Friends’ records. Adam Smith, who had not seen these records,
       but who wrote just when the work was being completed, thought
       differently. <cite>Wealth of Nations</cite> (ed. Rogers), I, 391.</p>

       distribution of the vote seems to have had no political, no
       religious, and probably no economic significance. The measure
       was popular in and out of the Assembly. <cite>Packet</cite>, Dec. 25,
       1779; <cite>Jour. of House, 1776&ndash;1781</cite>, p. 435. An earlier bill
       had been published in the <cite>Packet</cite>, Mar. 4, 1779. It is very
       interesting. The bill as finally drafted became the first act
       for the abolition of slavery in the United States. Accordingly
       its authors had to do much original and constructive work.
       In the course of the work their ideas underwent some change,
       and the transition is easily seen in comparing the first bill
       of 1779 with the act as passed in 1780. In some respects the
       first is more liberal than the second; in other respects
       less so. Thus at first it was intended to make the children
       of slaves servants until twenty-one only. (<cite>Packet</cite>, Mar. 4,
       1779). “A Citizen” discussing this objected that the master
       would receive inadequate compensation for rearing negro
       children, and urged that the age limit be made twenty-eight
       or even thirty. (<cite>Packet</cite>, Mar. 13, 1779), and so pay for the
       unproductive years, which was but just. The law made the age
       twenty-eight. On the other hand it was at first proposed to
       continue the prohibition of intermarriage and the permission
       to bind out idle free negroes. (<cite>Packet</cite>, Mar. 4, 1779). Both
       these provisions were omitted from the law.</p>

The numbers were 1790, <em>3737</em>; 1800, <em>1706</em>; 1810, <em>795</em>;
       1820, <em>211</em>; 1830, <em>67</em>; 1840, <em>64</em> (?). The U. S. Census
       Reports do not mention any after 1840, but it is said that
       James Clark of Donegal Township, Lancaster County, held a
       slave in 1860. <em>Cf.</em> W. J. McKnight, <cite>Pioneer Outline History
       of Northwestern Pennsylvania</cite>, 311. It is necessary to remark
       that the U. S. Census reported <em>386</em> as the number of slaves
       in 1830. As this was in increase of 175 over the number
       reported in 1820, it aroused consternation in Pennsylvania and
       amazement elsewhere, so that a committee of the Senate was
       immediately appointed to investigate. Their account showed
       that there had been no increase but a substantial diminution
       in numbers; and that the U. S. officers had been grossly
       careless, if not positively ignorant in their work. <cite>J. of S.,

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
